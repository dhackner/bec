You will be asked a series of questions and be advised to intervene if life threats are found.  Once you have intervened you should rapidly reassess the patient. If at any time the patient's condition changes, repeat the ABCDE assessment from the beginning. Remember that this app is a guide and should not take the place of clinical judgement.",
